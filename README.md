# Meta-Prod2Vec
[Original Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.07326.pdf)  
The purpose of this repo is to further investigate the ideas exposed in the Meta-Prod2Vec paper, in particular on the topic of homogenous representation learning of hetergenous data. With no particular use case in mind, any idea proposed should be tried as to compare with other approaches.

Note there is no reference implementation of MetaProd2Vec, and as so, there's no clear baseline to compare with. Also, the original dataset used in the paper is no longer available. Given this scenario, we are kinda on our own.
